      "* **Atmosphere:** Our planet is surrounded by a protective atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). This atmosphere traps heat, creating the greenhouse effect and allowing for life to thrive.\n",
      "* **Surface:** Earth's surface is divided into landmasses (continents) and oceans. About 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by water.\n",
      "* **Geology:** The Earth's crust is divided into tectonic plates that constantly move and interact, causing earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain formation.\n",
      "* **Climate:** Earth experiences a wide range of climates, from tropical rainforests to arid deserts, due to differences in latitude, altitude, and proximity to oceans.\n",
      "* **Life:** Earth is teeming with life, from microscopic bacteria to giant whales. The biosphere, the zone where life exists, encompasses all ecosystems on the planet.\n",
      "* **Moon:** Earth has a single natural satellite, the Moon, which plays a significant role in stabilizing the planet's rotation and influencing tides.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Earth is a complex and interconnected system:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Climate Change:** Human activities are causing significant changes to the Earth's climate, resulting in rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events.\n",
      "* **Biodiversity Loss:**  Human activities are also leading to a decline in biodiversity, threatening the stability of ecosystems and the services they provide.\n",
      "* **Resource Depletion:** Earth's resources are being depleted at an unsustainable rate, requiring us to find more sustainable ways of living.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Conservation:** We need to protect Earth's ecosystems and resources for future generations.\n",

      "**2. Plate Tectonics:** Earth's crust is broken into plates that move, causing earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain ranges. This dynamic system helps regulate Earth's climate and creates diverse environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Atmosphere:** Earth's atmosphere is a complex mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen and oxygen. This atmosphere provides protection from harmful solar radiation, regulates temperature, and allows for weather patterns.\n",

      "**For Speed and Simplicity:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Electric Kettle:** This is the fastest and easiest method. Simply fill the kettle, plug it in, and wait for it to boil.  \n",
      "* **Microwave:**  This is quick and convenient for small amounts of water. Be careful, as some microwaves don't have a boil setting and the water can overheat and erupt when you try to pour it. \n",

      "\n",
      "**Factors to Consider:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Amount of Water:** For small quantities, a microwave or electric kettle is best. For larger amounts, a pot on the stove is more efficient.\n",
      "* **Speed:** Electric kettles are the fastest, followed by microwaves and then pots on the stove.\n",
      "* **Energy Efficiency:** Electric kettles are generally the most energy efficient, followed by microwaves and then pots on the stove.\n",
      "* **Safety:** Be careful when using microwaves to boil water, and always use a pot with a lid when boiling water on the stove.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips for Boiling Water:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Use filtered water:** Filtered water tastes better and is healthier to drink.\n",
      "* **Don't overfill the kettle or pot:** Leave some space at the top to prevent spills.\n",

      "* **Turn off the heat source once the water boils:**  No need to keep it boiling longer.\n",

      "* **Scattering by molecules:** When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with tiny gas molecules like nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n",
      "* **Rayleigh scattering:**  These small molecules scatter the shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) much more strongly than the longer wavelengths (red and orange). This is because shorter wavelengths interact more with the molecules.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Why the sky isn't violet:** Even though violet light is scattered even more strongly than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light. This is why the sky appears blue rather than violet. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Other factors affecting sky color:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Time of day:** The sky appears redder at sunrise and sunset because sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere, scattering more blue light away, leaving more of the longer wavelengths to reach our eyes.\n",
      "* **Clouds:** Clouds are white because they are made of water droplets that are much larger than the wavelengths of light, so they scatter all wavelengths of light equally. \n",

      "\n",
      "**Additional Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Choose a language and stick with it:** Focus on learning one language well before jumping to others.\n",
      "* **Start with small projects and gradually increase complexity:** Don't try to build the next Facebook on your first try.\n",
      "* **Use online resources and communities:** There are countless tutorials, courses, and forums online to help you learn and get support.\n",

    "Another way to improve response quality is to add examples in your prompt. The LLM learns in-context from the examples on how to respond. Typically, one to five examples (shots) are enough to improve the quality of responses. Including too many examples can cause the model to over-fit the data and reduce the quality of responses.\n",

    "Similar to classical model training, the quality and distribution of the examples is very important. Pick examples that are representative of the scenarios that you need the model to learn, and keep the distribution of the examples (e.g. number of examples per class in the case of classification) aligned with your actual distribution."
